# Jukebox System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Jukebox System** is a console-based Java application that simulates a simple music player. It allows users to manage and play songs and podcasts through a menu-driven interface. The project is built using **Core Java** and focuses on strong application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

This project is designed to demonstrate clean class design, object interaction, and logical flow without relying on external frameworks.
